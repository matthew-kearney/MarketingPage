      Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. Those great big fluffy clouds.

      Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help.
